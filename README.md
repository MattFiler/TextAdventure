# Text Adventure Creation Tool
The aim of this project was to produce an engine agnostic designer focused tool for producing text adventures. 

The tool itself can be found with the "Story Tool" directory along with its source code.

The tool's output can be read in to one of three implementations across Unity, Unreal, and OpenGL (ASGE).

All implementations are complete with their source code, so feel free to expand this project to your requirements!

Documentation for the tool can be found within "Story Tool > Tools > docs" to get started.
