Create your story flowchart by launching Brainiac Designer and creating a new workspace.
In the workspace settings make sure to select TextAdventure.dll, and set both directories to a folder called "brainiac_output", relative to "StoryGenerator.exe".
Open a new file within Brainiac and save it as "main.xml".
Here you can create your story flowchart for the text adventure game. Guidelines for this are provided later.
Once finished, save your flowchart and navigate to "StoryGenerator.exe".
Run this program and you should now have a folder named "story_output".
If the program crashes then you have not followed the flowchart guidelines and may want to check your game logic.
If all has gone well, open the "story_output" folder and copy "story.json". Paste it into your game "Resources" directory and play!
