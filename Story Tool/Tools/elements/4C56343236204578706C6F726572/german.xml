  <string id="NOSTROMO_TOUCHDOWN" text="The Nostromo touches down on the planetoid and its heavy&#xD;&#xA;engines whirr down to silence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You sit in the airlock chamber, poised for action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A rattle of dust and debris whips across the airlock&#xD;&#xA;door infront of you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What wonders could await at the beacon?"></string>
  <string id="AIRLOCK_LOOKAROUND" text="The airlock chamber is a sterile place. Around you is &#xD;&#xA;your spacesuit and the door to the outside. A red light &#xD;&#xA;pulses gently and the hum of the ships systems tickles &#xD;&#xA;your ears."></string>
  <string id="EXIT_AIRLOCK" text="The airlock doors whirr into life and thud open in the &#xD;&#xA;new pressure of the planetoid's environment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You step out."></string>
  <string id="AIRLOCK_NOT_PRIMED" text="The airlock hasn't been primed. The pressure difference&#xD;&#xA;will tear the ship apart, and kill you in the process."></string>

  <string id="PUT_ON_SPACESUIT" text="You pick up your spacesuit's helmet and click it into&#xD;&#xA;place. The world becomes muffled and you can feel your&#xD;&#xA;heart beating to the pulse of the red light above the&#xD;&#xA;airlock doors."></string>
  <string id="NOT_WEARING_SUIT" text="You aren't wearing your spacesuit. The change in pressure&#xD;&#xA;will cause servere damage to your vital organs."></string>
  <string id="PRIMED_AIRLOCK" text="Through your suit you feel a change in pressure as&#xD;&#xA;the pulse of the red light increases. There is a burst &#xD;&#xA;of white smoke and the light calms again."></string>
  <string id="OUTER_AIRLOCK_INTRO" text="You step outside the airlock.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wind whistles across your visor, and the sound of flying&#xD;&#xA;rubble fills your ears through the muffled suit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just in front of you is the derelict, and behind you&#xD;&#xA;is the airlock you just left.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You feel alone with your thoughts in this harsh place."></string>
  <string id="OUTER_AIRLOCK_LOOKAROUND" text="You look out across the vast nothing, and into the fog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wind whips debris across the land infront of you, which&#xD;&#xA;is pulled in twisted shapes and formations from the&#xD;&#xA;harsh conditions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just infront of you is the derelict ship, you can see&#xD;&#xA;what looks like an entrance to it."></string>
