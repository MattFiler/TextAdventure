  <string id="NOSTROMO_TOUCHDOWN" text="The Nostromo touches down on the planetoid and its heavy&#xD;&#xA;engines whirr down to silence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You sit in the airlock chamber, poised for action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A rattle of dust and debris whips across the airlock&#xD;&#xA;door infront of you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What wonders could await at the beacon?"></string>
  <string id="AIRLOCK_LOOKAROUND" text="The airlock chamber is a sterile place. Around you is &#xD;&#xA;your spacesuit and the door to the outside. A red light &#xD;&#xA;pulses gently and the hum of the ships systems tickles &#xD;&#xA;your ears."></string>
  <string id="EXIT_AIRLOCK" text="The airlock doors whirr into life and thud open in the &#xD;&#xA;new pressure of the planetoid's environment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You step out."></string>
  <string id="AIRLOCK_NOT_PRIMED" text="The airlock hasn't been primed. The pressure difference&#xD;&#xA;will tear the ship apart, and kill you in the process."></string>
  <string id="ALREADY_WEARING_SUIT" text="You are already wearing your spacesuit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quit stalling!"></string>
  <string id="PUT_ON_SPACESUIT" text="You pick up your spacesuit's helmet and click it into&#xD;&#xA;place. The world becomes muffled and you can feel your&#xD;&#xA;heart beating to the pulse of the red light above the&#xD;&#xA;airlock doors."></string>
  <string id="NOT_WEARING_SUIT" text="You aren't wearing your spacesuit. The change in &#xD;&#xA;pressure will cause servere damage to your vital organs."></string>
  <string id="PRIMED_AIRLOCK" text="Through your suit you feel a change in pressure as&#xD;&#xA;the pulse of the red light increases. There is a burst &#xD;&#xA;of white smoke and the light calms again."></string>
  <string id="OUTER_AIRLOCK_INTRO" text="You step outside the airlock.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wind whistles across your visor, and the sound of flying&#xD;&#xA;rubble fills your ears through the muffled suit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just in front of you is the derelict, and behind you&#xD;&#xA;is the airlock you just left.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You feel alone with your thoughts in this harsh place."></string>
  <string id="OUTER_AIRLOCK_LOOKAROUND" text="Wind whips debris across the land infront of you, which&#xD;&#xA;is pulled in twisted shapes and formations from the&#xD;&#xA;harsh conditions. Just infront of you is the derelict &#xD;&#xA;ship, you can see what looks like an entrance to it."></string>
  <string id="BY_DERELICT_INTRO" text="Infront of you is a monolithic structure like nothing&#xD;&#xA;you have ever seen. Ribbed organic-like beams run down&#xD;&#xA;its sides, and it as a whole arcs up to the sky and&#xD;&#xA;into the fog above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is what looks like an opening just infront of where&#xD;&#xA;you stand, clear of all debris.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You want to go inside."></string>
  <string id="MOVE_TO_DERELICT" text="You walk towards the derelict ship, avoiding the wind&#xD;&#xA;warped rocks that cover your path.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you approach it, you understand its scale. It's an&#xD;&#xA;ungodly size - far larger than anything a human could&#xD;&#xA;create."></string>
  <string id="BACK_TO_AIRLOCK" text="You walk back inside to the safety of the airlock, not&#xD;&#xA;ready to face the harsh conditions outside the ship.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You've got to leave at some point!"></string>
  <string id="LOOK_AROUND_DERELICT_EXT" text="The ship engulfs the landscape.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Infront of you seems to be a now clear enterance point, &#xD;&#xA;and behind you, your ship."></string>
  <string id="GO_BACK_TO_SHIP" text="Scared by the giantic creation infront, you dart back&#xD;&#xA;to the ship as quick as your suit will allow you to&#xD;&#xA;run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This isn't how explorers should behave!"></string>
  <string id="BY_DERELICT_INTRO_B" text="You approach the derelict ship, the wind whistles on the&#xD;&#xA;outside of your suit still.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Infront of you is a monolithic structure like nothing&#xD;&#xA;you have ever seen. Ribbed organic-like beams run down&#xD;&#xA;its sides, and it as a whole arcs up to the sky and&#xD;&#xA;into the fog above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You think you can see an opening up ahead, but debris&#xD;&#xA;blocks your path to it. Your explosives may come in&#xD;&#xA;handy to clear your route."></string>
  <string id="LOOK_AROUND_DERELICT_EXT_B" text="Infront of you is what looks like an enterance to the&#xD;&#xA;derelict ship, but it is blocked by debris. In your&#xD;&#xA;backpack are some explosives that may come in handy&#xD;&#xA;to clear your path."></string>
  <string id="USE_EXPLOSIVES" text="You place your explosives on the rubble and step back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The detonator clicks in your hand and a dust cloud fills&#xD;&#xA;your vision. As it clears, you can see your clear path&#xD;&#xA;ahead."></string>
  <string id="APPROACH_DERELICT" text="You approach the derelict's enterance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is is dark and wet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hairs on your skin stand on end as you near."></string>
